# Legal Compliance Audit Report - AIHomeworkHelper App

**Date:** January 29, 2025  
**Auditor:** Legal Compliance Guardian  
**Risk Level:** ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL** - Immediate action required

## Executive Summary

The AIHomeworkHelper app faces **catastrophic legal compliance failures** that could result in regulatory fines, app store removal, and potential criminal liability similar to the TEA app breach. The app clearly targets minors (students) but has NO age verification, NO parental consent mechanisms, and stores sensitive homework images containing potential PII indefinitely without proper safeguards.

## Critical Compliance Violations

### 1. COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) - ðŸ”´ CRITICAL

**Violations Identified:**
- **NO age verification system** - App allows children under 13 to use without any checks
- **NO parental consent mechanism** - Direct collection from minors without guardian approval
- **NO parental access controls** - Parents cannot review/delete their children's data
- **Homework images stored indefinitely** - May contain names, addresses, school info
- **Device ID collection from minors** - Tracking without consent

**Legal Exposure:**
- Civil penalties up to **$51,744 per violation**
- FTC enforcement actions
- Class action lawsuits from parents
- Criminal charges if data is breached

### 2. Data Retention & Security - ðŸ”´ CRITICAL

**Current State:**
```javascript
// server.js - Line 239-243
await pool.query(
  'INSERT INTO problems (user_id, question, subject, solution) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)',
  [user.id, question, subject, solution]
);
```

**Issues:**
- Homework data stored **permanently** with no deletion policy
- Images containing PII stored as base64 in database
- No encryption at rest for sensitive data
- No data minimization - full images stored when only text needed
- No automatic purging of old data

**TEA App Parallel:** Like TEA storing 72,000 private images, this app accumulates homework images indefinitely.

### 3. FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) - ðŸŸ¡ HIGH RISK

**Violations:**
- Storing educational records without proper consent
- No verification of user identity for access
- Homework may contain grades, teacher comments, school info
- No audit trail for who accesses educational data

### 4. GDPR/CCPA Compliance - ðŸ”´ CRITICAL

**Missing Requirements:**
- **No data deletion mechanism** - Users cannot delete their data
- **No data export functionality** - GDPR Article 20 violation
- **No consent management** - Processing without lawful basis
- **No privacy-by-design** - Collects more data than necessary
- **Cross-border transfers** without safeguards (US servers, global users)

### 5. Privacy Policy Inaccuracies - ðŸŸ¡ HIGH RISK

**Current Policy Claims vs Reality:**

| Privacy Policy States | Actual Implementation |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| "We do not store homework problems on servers after processing" | Problems stored permanently in PostgreSQL |
| "Historical data retained until you delete it" | No deletion mechanism exists |
| "We do not knowingly collect from children under 13" | No age verification to prevent this |
| "You can delete all app data by uninstalling" | Server retains data after app deletion |

### 6. Platform Policy Violations - ðŸŸ¡ HIGH RISK

**Apple App Store:**
- Apps for kids must include privacy practices
- Parental gates required for apps targeting children
- Clear data retention and deletion policies required

**Current App Store listing shows 4+ rating but lacks required child safety features.**

## Data Flow Analysis

```
User (potentially minor) â†’ Takes photo of homework â†’ 
Image uploaded to server â†’ Base64 encoded â†’ 
Stored permanently in database â†’ Never deleted
```

**PII Risk in Homework Images:**
- Student names on papers
- School letterheads
- Teacher comments with identifying info
- Home addresses on assignments
- Parent signatures

## Immediate Actions Required

### Phase 1: Emergency Mitigation (24-48 hours)

1. **Implement Age Gate**
```swift
struct AgeVerificationView: View {
    @State private var birthDate = Date()
    @State private var showParentalConsent = false
    
    var body: some View {
        if userAge < 13 {
            ParentalConsentFlow()
        } else if userAge < 16 {
            // GDPR parental consent for EU
        }
    }
}
```

2. **Add Data Retention Policy**
```javascript
// Add to server.js
const DATA_RETENTION_DAYS = 30;

// Cron job to delete old data
async function purgeOldData() {
  await pool.query(`
    DELETE FROM problems 
    WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '${DATA_RETENTION_DAYS} days'
  `);
}
```

3. **Implement Delete Account Function**
```javascript
app.delete('/api/v1/users/me', authenticateToken, async (req, res) => {
  await pool.query('DELETE FROM problems WHERE user_id = $1', [req.user.id]);
  await pool.query('DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id = $1', [req.user.id]);
  await pool.query('DELETE FROM users WHERE id = $1', [req.user.id]);
  res.json({ message: 'Account deleted' });
});
```

### Phase 2: COPPA Compliance (1 week)

1. **Verifiable Parental Consent System**
   - Email verification with parent
   - Credit card verification ($0.10 charge)
   - Video consent option
   - Signed consent form upload

2. **Parental Dashboard**
   - View child's homework history
   - Delete specific problems
   - Download all data
   - Manage consent settings

3. **Data Minimization**
   - Process images locally when possible
   - Only store text, not images
   - Implement on-device OCR

### Phase 3: Full Compliance (2 weeks)

1. **Privacy Policy Rewrite**
   - Accurate data handling descriptions
   - Clear retention periods
   - Parental rights section
   - International transfer disclosures

2. **Technical Implementation**
   - Encryption at rest for all PII
   - Audit logging for data access
   - Automated data purging
   - Consent preference center

3. **GDPR/CCPA Features**
   - Right to deletion API
   - Data portability export
   - Consent withdrawal mechanism
   - Do Not Sell implementation

## Legal Risk Matrix

| Compliance Area | Current Risk | Potential Fine | Likelihood |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| COPPA | ðŸ”´ Critical | $51,744 per violation | Very High |
| GDPR | ðŸ”´ Critical | 4% global revenue | High |
| CCPA | ðŸŸ¡ High | $7,500 per violation | Medium |
| FERPA | ðŸŸ¡ High | Federal funding loss | Medium |
| Data Breach | ðŸ”´ Critical | Unlimited liability | High |

## Comparison to TEA App Breach

| Factor | TEA App | AIHomeworkHelper |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Exposed Government IDs | 13,000 | Risk: Student IDs in homework |
| Private Images | 72,000 | Currently storing all homework images |
| Data Retention | Indefinite | Indefinite (same risk) |
| Encryption | None | None for stored data |
| Access Controls | Weak | Device ID only |
| Age Verification | None | None |

## Recommended Compliance Stack

1. **OneTrust** - Privacy management platform
2. **Usercentrics** - Consent management
3. **Auth0** - Identity management with age verification
4. **AWS KMS** - Encryption key management
5. **Datadog** - Compliance monitoring

## Conclusion

The AIHomeworkHelper app is a **compliance time bomb** with exposure similar to or worse than the TEA app breach. The combination of:
- Targeting minors without protections
- Storing homework images with PII indefinitely  
- No deletion mechanisms
- Inaccurate privacy policy

Creates a perfect storm for regulatory action, data breaches, and legal liability.

**Recommendation:** Suspend new user registrations immediately until Phase 1 mitigations are complete. Consider engaging external counsel specializing in COPPA compliance.
