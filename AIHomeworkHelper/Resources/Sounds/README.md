# Sound Effects Placeholder

This directory contains placeholder sound effect files for the AI Homework Helper app.

## Sound Files Needed:

1. **streak_celebration.mp3** - A celebratory chime for streak achievements
2. **badge_unlock.mp3** - A rewarding unlock sound for new badges
3. **scan_complete.mp3** - A completion sound after scanning
4. **points_earned.mp3** - A coin/point collection sound
5. **level_up.mp3** - An uplifting level-up fanfare

## Placeholder Implementation:

Since we cannot generate actual audio files programmatically, these sounds will use the system sounds defined in SoundManager.swift as fallbacks. 

To add real sounds:
1. Create or obtain royalty-free sound effects in .mp3 or .m4a format
2. Keep them under 30 seconds and optimized for size (< 100KB each)
3. Name them exactly as listed above
4. Add them to this directory
5. Include them in the Xcode project

## System Sound IDs Used as Fallbacks:
- tap: 1104
- success: 1025  
- error: 1053
- unlock: 1003

The app will gracefully fall back to these system sounds when custom audio files are not found.
